## Datastructures and Alghoritms

This thorough course that I took on learning C/C++ algorithms and data structures provides a well-organized, in-depth examination of core ideas that are essential for any aspiring software engineer or programmer. The course is offered through Udemy and offers a comprehensive learning experience by fusing theoretical knowledge with real-world application.

My comprehension of fundamental data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, has improved.
I gain knowledge of their traits, applications, and effective C and C++ implementation.

I am well-versed in sorting, searching, and many optimisation techniques. I look into classic algorithms, such as quicksort, mergesort, binary search, and more, understanding their temporal and spatial complexity.

I gain knowledge of greedy algorithms and dynamic programming, two useful strategies for resolving difficult problems. I apply these techniques to real-world scenarios and optimisation issues.

> Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. Linus Torvalds
