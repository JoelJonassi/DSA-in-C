# Data Structures and Algorithms  

This repository showcases my learning journey through a comprehensive course on data structures and algorithms using C/C++. The course, offered through Udemy, provides a well-structured and in-depth exploration of foundational concepts essential for aspiring software engineers and programmers.  

## Overview of Learning  
Through this course, I gained:  

- **Understanding of Core Data Structures**:  
  Mastery over fundamental data structures such as:  
  - **Arrays**  
  - **Linked Lists**  
  - **Stacks and Queues**  
  - **Trees**  
  - **Graphs**  

  Each data structure was examined for its characteristics, applications, and efficient implementation in C and C++.  

- **Algorithmic Proficiency**:  
  In-depth knowledge of key algorithms, including:  
  - Sorting techniques: *Quicksort*, *Mergesort*, and more  
  - Searching algorithms: *Binary Search*  
  - Analysis of time and space complexity for all algorithms  

- **Advanced Problem-Solving Techniques**:  
  - Greedy algorithms: Efficient strategies for optimization problems  
  - Dynamic programming: Solutions for complex, multi-step problems  
  - Application of these techniques to real-world scenarios  

## Repository Navigation  
This repository is organized into folders for specific topics. Each folder includes:  
- **Code Implementations**: Examples and exercises for each concept  
- **Additional Resources**: Supplementary materials for deeper understanding
